A Computer Vision and Image processing pipeline:

  Denoising the images with various filters some inbuilt and some on the spot implemented, calculate denoising score
  Gradient Image and kurtosis measurement of the image
  Segmentation using noise-sensitive and noise-invariant methods, calculate segmentation validation score
  Classification of segmented images using Machine Learning, classify on the basis of Histograms of Curvature using a KNN Classifier
  In image object classification using CNN + ANN layers and Transfer Learning using InceptionV3 model.
