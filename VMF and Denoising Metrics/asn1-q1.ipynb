    "For this you should add `import pandas as pd` to the list of boilerplate imports, above.  Then use the pd.read_csv() function and give the path to the images.csv file as an argument, and also give the optional argument `headers=None` because the given .csv file does not have column title headers.  This will return a Pandas dataframe with one column containing the filenames.  We could iterate over the dataframe, but in order to not have to get too deep into the use of Pandas dataframes, we can convert the single column dataframe to a Python list easily.  If the dataframe is referred to by a variable called `files`, we can convert the first column to a list using:  `files[0].tolist()`.  This will return a list of strings, one for each filename that we can now easily iterate over using a for-loop.\n"
