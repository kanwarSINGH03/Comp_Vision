Given an image, we just want to obtain it's histogram without modifying the image.  This can be done with the np.histogram() function which returns two arrays:  a one-dimensional numpy array containing the bin counts for each bin of the histogram, and an array called `bin_edges` which we can ignore.  But remember that the return value is a tuple of two items and we only need the first one of the pair containing the bin counts.\n"
